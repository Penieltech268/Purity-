     <h3>WHY SEXUAL PURITY?</h3>
     <p>
       1 corintians 6:15-20:
       <br>
       <br>
        "15 Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.
        <br>
        <br>
        16 What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.
       <br>
       <br>
        17 But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.
       <br>
       <br>
        18 Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.
       <br>
       <br>
       19 What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?
       <br>
       <br>
        20 For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's."
